# Magnolia WebGL/WebGPU Benchmarker v0.4.2
### Browser based WebGL/WebGPU benchmarker written in TypeScript.

### Changes:
- UI for changing API and amount of triangles.

### TODO:
- Timed benchmark-sequence, which gradually increases the amount of triangles to certain point where FPS is below 10 then changes API performing the same procedure (optional).
- Write a script that automatically updates benchmark-results.

### Wishlist:
- Scenes and SceneManager implementation (for the game engine).
- Support for more complex geometry (for the game engine).
- Desktop version
